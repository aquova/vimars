# vimars

My personal Neovim configuration and setup scripts, now with a cute repo name.

https://github.com/aquova/vimars

## Overview

Installation scripts for my Neovim configuration. Installs lightweight plugins, colorscheme, and optimal settings.

## Installation

These scripts do not actually install Neovim, you will need to do that yourself. Visit https://neovim.io for more information.

Run `./vim_install.sh`. The script will create the necessary folder structure and install the plugins and colorschemes into their correct places. The script assumes you have `git` installed.
